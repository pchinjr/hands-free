Creating a database and management system for a babywearing lending library 

Uses Hapi framework with Mongodb. 

There will be an admin account for the librarian, who can track and manage the lending library inventory. Volunteers at the meeting can sign in to administer the library. Eventually the public will be able to see the contents of the library.
